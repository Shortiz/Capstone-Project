    <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
    <div>American Bank is more than a financial institution in the communites
      we serve; we are a part of them as well. We help to make our communities better
      place to live and work by being an important contributor of time,
      talent, and resources.
    </div>
    <p>Community First, the Bank's employee charitable and social committee, is in its 38th year of fundraising. Since its inception in 1983, the Committee has
       raised every donation internally, reflecting Peoples Bank employees' commitment to dig deep and make a dedicated effort to improve the quality of life in 
       the communities in which we work and live. </p>

      <p>In 2020, through generous employee donations and matching funds from the Bank, Community First distributed more than $70,000 to benefit organizations 
        such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northwest PA, Haven Palace, Legacy Foundation, Food Bank of Northwest PA, Cancer Resource Center, 
        and Opportunity Enterprises.</p>
      
      <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee donated $28,651 to local Northwest PA  nonprofit organizations over 
        a six-month period through their Casual for a Cause initiative. The initiative was put into motion as a way to help local communities be more successful 
        at a time when they needed it most.</p>
